## Topic: Object Retrieval with Micro-ROV ##

In this project, a Micro-ROV will be developed as a low-cost telerobotic submarine built with the goal of exploring small and unknown underwater areas. At this stage the initial prototype development was limited, starting from the design to the manufacturing, and testing the performance of the prototype which included tightness, stability and mobility. Expectations for the future to be further developed include the addition of camera features, improved performance, other sensor features and so on. The prototype in this project will be made using 3D-Printing technology because this is an alternative way for fabrication the Micro-Class underwater ROV so it can make various parts with shapes and sizes that are in accordance with the desired design.

## Objectives ##
1. Make a PCB Board that integrates with the main system of the Primary ROV
2. Customize the Micro-ROV frame
3. Design a 3D-Print Servo Gripper and a thruster frame
4. Use CAN Bus protocol for communication between Micro-ROV and main ROV

## Success Criteria ##
1. Able to send the view back to the ground station
2. Able to retrieve the object by using the gripper while only very limited space is available
3. Provide two communication modes:
4. UART, or Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter
5. CAN Bus Communication
6. Provide flexibility of replacing assemblies
